<p>[OPEN ON SOUNDS OF CRICKETS, AND CRUNCHING LEAVES]</p>
<p>[Notes for Athina: Keep voice low, brusque, and soft-spoken. Not angry, but fierce - think Daisy Tonner vibes]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Hello friends and foes, fiends and foreigners, familiars and fae. It’s me, the one known far and wide as Vikki Other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Hurry it up, Other. We don’t have all day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I’m with Axel currently. Outside. It’s dark, and the sky is devoid of stars for once. I believe in omens, of course, though I don’t know if I believe in good or bad. This certainly could be either. So, from my timeline to yours… welcome to Radio Other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY HUM THE INTRO BADLY. COMEDY? POSSIBLY]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: You better be keeping my name out of this, Other. I told you I wanted my work kept private.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oh! Right! Sorry, of course, of course.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Good. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE, WALKING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: So. What’s the plan?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Huh?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: We hop the fence, get the back door, then what?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oh! Uh, well, I sorta remember the layout of the city hall from our trip there in seventh grade. And I think I remember some of the police station from freshman year… </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Get to the point, Other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I’ll lead when we get there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[AXEL SNORTS IN AMUSEMENT]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Like hell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Hang on- one second. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: What?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I’m going to try something. Just… don’t freak out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: You better not be trying to-</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEIR VOICE IS CUT OFF AS BILLIE OPENS. THIS TIME, VIKKI SOFTLY CHANTS ALONG]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Holy fucking hell- what the fuck-</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Sorry, that was Bil- my third eye. I’ve got it. We’ll need to shut off the cameras along the fence  - can you do that?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Obviously. I got one of mine to take care of the Watcher too, so she should be good. [CLATTERING] Signal scrambler. It should interfere with the CCTV long enough for us to get in. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Perfect. After that, we’ll need to take two lefts, and we’ll be out of the backrooms and near the main sector. There’s a hallway there that goes to archives - it goes below the police station though, so we’ll have to be quiet. I think those snazzy snipers might also keep their files down in the dark. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: And what would it cost for me to get you to talk normal?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I’m afraid my dynamic dialogue is priceless, Mx Ha- [THEY STOP] Mx A. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[AXEL SIGHS] </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Might as well just use my name. You’ve already said it as it is.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oh sweet candied petunias, thank the forest beast. Good lord, that was a golly struggle. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A, exasperated : Of course that’s what you think is a struggle. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: It is!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Alright. We’re approaching the perimeter. 20 meters, give or take. Wait one sec. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[A BUZZING SOUND. TECH STUFF IS HAPPENING.]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A, cont: There. Cameras should be fried. We’re in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Great! Fantabulous. Onto fence hopping. You first?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Sure</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY CLIMB THE FENCE] </p>
<p></p>
<p>[A GRUNTS AS THEY LAND]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Shit. Right. Door? </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Over there-</p>
<p></p>
<p>[They walk over. Axel stops]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Shit. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Whatsit now? </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Masterlock. These things take a hot second.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I bet I can get it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Don’t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Hang on-</p>
<p></p>
<p>[A LOCK WHIRRS… AND CLICKS]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Whoo-hoo!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A, hissing: Keep your voice down! </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: See? Shouldn’ta doubted me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A, disgruntled: Congrats. Sorry if It’s hard to take someone in hot pink double-denim seriously. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: It’s my first  real heist! I wanted to dress for the occasion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: You look like a flamingo. Congrats. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[THE DOOR OPENS] </p>
<p>[NOTE: ALL DIALOGUE THROUGHOUT THIS SHOULD BE HISSED IN A LOWER TONE. THEY’RE BEING SUBTLE/SNEAKY]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V, quiet: The fluorescent lights buzz overhead, down the dimly lit hallway. Tile floors, open doors. A cross between a hospital and a horror movie.There’s something deeply familiar about this. Nostalgic, even-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Okay seriously, cut that out. We don’t need to record every detail. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Fine.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY KEEP WALKING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>[EVENTUALLY THEY STOP]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: This is it. Archives. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Got that from the sign, Other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Right. [NOT SOUNDING SORRY] Sorry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THEY SLOWLY WALK DOWN]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Don’t walk so heavily. You’re making the floorboards creak like a shotgun. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Alright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: My light-walking. I am a feather, you see.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Other, I-</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: My limbs are glass. I am one with the wind. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Your face is this close to being one with my fist, Other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: And I will scream loudly, and ruin everything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: …Assuming you don’t ruin things anyways. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEIR FOOTSTEPS SHIFT TO TILE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Where’s the file?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I….</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I don’t know. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: God fucking dam-</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: There! There’s a computer in the corner. Let’s use it. We can look it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: It’s password protected. Do you know the password?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: … No. [PAUSE] Wish Lizzy was here for this. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Actually… Move aside. I’ve got it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Huh? What are you-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Don’t.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[TYPING] </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Alright. We have guest access. [RUMMAGING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: A flash drive? What will that-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: It has a virus on it that will corrupt any of the standard blocking software they have in place.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[SHUFFLING, TYPING CONTINUES]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oooh! I once had a bug in my laptop!! </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Good for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: It was an ant. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A, distracted: Cool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: It chewed through the internal circuits and accidentally tripled in size and grew an extra set of limbs. I thought it was cute but the government wouldn’t let me keep it as a pet when they came to retrieve it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Hm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[A LITTLE “BLIP” HAPPENS]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A and V: We’re in.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Ooh!! I’ve always wanted to say that. I feel like a crazy hacker in a spy movie. Which, I basically am at this point. Which way do you think I have to turn my head to look into the camera so I can break the fourth wall and go kill the director? Push it in an existential surrealist angle. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: You ramble when you’re nervous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: No I don’t! I mean- what?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: It’s annoying. So I’m pointing it out. So you’ll stop.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: … oh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Here. This is the database search. Go wild. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Alright.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[TYPING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Uh… Vikki…. Other…. Okay. 5 Files showed up. What do I do?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Are they physical or digital?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: These are digital. Well… except for the last one. That says… file destroyed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Ignore that one, focus on the rest. I’ve got another flash drive. Plug it to the secondary USB on the side and export them into it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: How do I…</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Oh my- just let me do this part. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[CLICKING, TYPING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Done. What now? </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Uh… search “John F Kennedy Junior”</p>
<p></p>
<p>[TYPING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Got 4 of these. 3 digital, one locked up. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Ignore the fourth one, get the-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Hang on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: What? What’s up?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: This one has a tag. WBY-OGD-E. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: So-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: It’s not formatted right. This was put in by someone who doesn’t work here. Hang on-</p>
<p></p>
<p>[CLICKING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: There’s eight documents under this tag. Four of them are unavailable, two are filed in other locations. One  of them is the other one we already talked about. But one of these… it’s in the same sub-series as the Kennedy file. And it’s basically been wiped of data. No provenance. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Sub-series?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Look, I’m not an archivist, so don’t take my word for this but - usually, file management has five levels - fonds, series, sub-series, file, item. This means it’s grouped in the same category. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Should we…</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Dunno, Other. I’m asking you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Yes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Got it. [TYPING] I’ve scanned the reference code. It’s a tape recording. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I have a player.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Perfect. [THEY UNPLUG THE DRIVES] Here. Keep the drive in your pocket… or, one of them, anyways. Then let’s go. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[CLICK]</p>
<p>[CLICK]</p>
<p></p>
<p>[EVERYTHING FROM HERE ON OUT SHOULD BE COMPLETELY WHISPERED]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: How much farther?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: 20 feet. Stop asking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Sorry. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[A LETS OUT A LOW HUFF] </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Some of these files look really neat. This one’s about something called the Foundation… huh… the Hard-To-Destroy reptile. And ooh, this one says it’s on timeline inconsistencies! And look, it’s dated two weeks from now! </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Stop that- just- keep walking. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Hey, don’t- </p>
<p></p>
<p>[A LOW CLATTER ECHOES]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: What was that?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Fuck- hang back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY STOP. BOTH BREATHE SHAKILY]</p>
<p></p>
<p>[A DOOR OPENS FROM A WHILE AWAY]</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: You got any plans for after work? </p>
<p></p>
<p>2: Ah, sorry. No can do. Got some group therapy thing going on. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Thought you said Cassie wanted to quit that?</p>
<p></p>
<p>2: This is a different one - it’s specifically for parents who got their firstborns taken. A bit more specific. I think she’s liking it better. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Ahh. Good, good. Happy things are getting on, man.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2: Hell yeah. </p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY LAUGH]</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Hold up- think that’s the one.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[FOOTSTEPS GET CLOSER. BREATHING PICKS UP]</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Yep. Here we go. Damn, it’s dusty down here. Whoever runs this dump should get her ass down here and clean every once and a while.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2: Hey, I’ve seen the old bag, don’t do Amber like that. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1: What? She blind as a bat and goin’ senile? </p>
<p></p>
<p>2: Maybe. Don’t think she has eyes. Plenty of thorns on those tentacles though, and a library science degree to boot, so I’d say sentient at least. </p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Of course it might not be, with all those social justice move… [THEIR VOICES FADE OUT, THE DOOR CLOSING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>[VIKKI RELEASES A BREATH]</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Holy Azathoth… that was close…</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Way too close. Shit. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: What do we-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Keep going. And pick up the pace.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[THEY KEEP WALKING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Stop. There. Bottom shelf, to the side. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: In the box? </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Yep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Alright. [RUSTLING] I think I got it. This the right code?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Perfect. Now let’s-</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Hey, who's there? </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Shit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: What do we do?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Run. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: What-?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: GO! </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Okay, okay!</p>
<p></p>

<p>[THEY BEGIN RUNNING]</p>
<p></p>
<p>1: Hey! Who are you?!</p>

<p>V: Your worst nightmare, buckaroo!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Don’t shout after them, idiot! Sweet Tiamat… </p>

<p></p>
<p>V: … Thanks… for… that…</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Shut…. Up…  </p>
<p>V: Seriously… [THEY REGAIN THEIR BREATH SLIGHTLY] That was helpful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Of course. Whatever. You still got everything?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Yep. Flash drive, tape, and… Otherphone. Good. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: What are you even recording this for?</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Um… my show?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: You’re not going to fucking play this on the radio.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Well… er… that might…</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>… be a good idea. I won’t. You’re right.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Good. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V, stressed: Right. </p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Thanks Other…</p>
<p></p>
<p>[PAUSE]</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Now, I’m going to want hazard pay. I know you paid up front, but we almost got caught there. That was dangerous. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Oh! Uh, okay. How much were you thinking, like-</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Just stand still.</p>

<p>A: Done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Ugh… why’d you do that?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Thought it might be cathartic. Y’know, I knew you in school, Other. You weren’t exactly the most pleasant person back then. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: Huh? I- people liked me back then!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: [LAUGHS] Sure. They thought you were funny. But that’s a long way from being liked. You seriously think people liked having you gallivanting around with the blonde and her friends, sticking your microphone into peoples faces and asking them basically unanswerable questions? No. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: But… I don’t see how that means giving me a bloody nose?</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: … you’re right. Guess it doesn’t. Huh. Maybe I just found you irritating enough tonight that it felt justified. </p>
<p></p>
<p>V: I… [PAUSE] okay then.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A: Whatever. Get out of here before I turn your insides into fish filet, Other.</p>
